Developed a weather application using swift. It's an online application that is used to show weather to users for a particular location or current location. Weather data were received from weather API data (REST API) and then converted to codable data. Used vector image for a background image that will change with respect to mobile appearance(dark or light). The app will show an alert view if the city entered is wrong or empty. For fetching the user's current location CoreLocation framework was used.
